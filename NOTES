Notes on CupL
=============

All data is stored and passed around in a struct called analysis with the
following fields:

Preprocessing fields
--------------------

                  of x,y,z

.trackCellIdx: 1xNt, cell index of tracks

.trackCoords: Tx3Nt, coordinates of each track in concatenated columns
              of x,y,z

.trackInt: Cx1 struct, track intensity structure with subfields:
           .mean: 
           .max
           .min
           .median

.maxTrackLength: scalar, # timepoints in longest track 
                 (== size(.sisterCoords1,1))

.time: 1xT, timepoints

.sisterNanCount: 1xNs, # of NaNs in each sister track

.trackNanCount: 1xNt, # of NaNs in each track

.nAcceptedSistersPerCell: Ncx1, # of accepted sisters in each cell

.nAcceptedTracksPerCell: Ncx1, # of accepted tracks in each cell

.nAcceptedSisters: scalar, total # of accepted sisters

.nAcceptedTracks: scalar, total # of accepted tracks

.nAcceptedCells: scalar, total # of accepted cells

.acceptedCells: logical 1xNc, indicating which cells are accepted

.inspectionAcceptedCells: logical 1xNc, indicating which cells were
                          explicitly accepted by the user

.acceptedSisters: logical 1xNs, indicating which sisters are accepted

.acceptedTracks: logical 1xNs, indicating which tracks are accepted

.acceptedSisterCellIdx: 1xMs, indicating cell index of accepted sisters
                        (== .sisterCellIdx(.acceptedSisters))

.acceptedTrackCellIdx: 1xMt, indicating cell index of accepted tracks
                        (== .trackCellIdx(.acceptedTracks))

.sisterCentreCoords: Tx3Ns, coordinates of sister pair centres in
                     concatenated columns of x,y,z

.sisterCentrePos: Nsx3, coordinates of mean sister pair centre position

.trackPos: Ntx3, coordinates of mean track position

.cellCentres: Ncx3, coordinates of cell centres

.sisterRadii: Nsx1, distance of sister pair mean position from cell centre

.trackRadii: Ntx1, distance of track mean position from cell centre

.pairIdx: struct, indexes for various sister/track pairings, see Analysis section for details
   .sisters
       .ind: Px4, where P = 4*sum(nchoosek(Q_i,2)), Q_i = # of accepted sister pairs in cell i,
                  and columns are [sister, paired sister, coords1/2 1st track,
                                   coords1/2 2nd track, combined coords1/2 index 1 and 2]
       .pair: Px2, where P = sum(nchoosek(Q_i,2))
   .tracks
       .ind: Px2, where P = sum(nchoosek(Q_i,2)), Q_i = # of accepted tracks in cell i


NB: Be careful to use the right indexing. If indexing into e.g. .sisterCoords1,
use e.g. find(.acceptedSisters & .sistersCellIdx == cellIdx). If indexing into
data which is already filtered for accepted sisters, use something like
find(.acceptedSistersCellIdx == cellIdx).

Analysis fields
---------------

Each field resulting from analysis has, where appropriate, additional subfields:
     with prefixes m_, s_ and e_ indicating overall mean, standard deviation, and
          standard error.
     with prefixes cm_, cs_ and ce_ indicating mean, stddev, stderr per cell.

Where analysis is done pairwise the following groups of pairings are distinguished
   (nb, these are always within the same cell):
   under .sisters:-
      .ind: individual track to any other non-sister individual track pairings
      .pair: sister pair centre to any other sister pair centre pairings
      .sister: sister to its own sister pairings
   under .tracks:-
      .ind: individual track to any other individual track pairings
For numbers of possible pairings see the 


.autocorrs: struct, autocorrelation analysis
     .dx: LxMs normal displacement of sister centres
     .dd: LxMs displacement of sister separation

.distances: struct, pairwise distance analysis
     .d:  Px1 Euclidean distance

.crosscorrs: struct, pairwise crosscorrelation analysis
     .dx: LxP crosscorrelation of normal displacement


where Nc, Nt, Ns refers to # of cells, tracks or sisters
      Mc, Mt, Ms refers to # of accepted cells, tracks or sisters
      T is the # of timepoints
      C is # of channels
      L is the # of lags (== T-1)
      P refers to the number of pairings as described under .pairIdx
        



Analysis is controlled by the options struct which is another subfield of
the analysis struct, with the following fields:

.percentNan: scalar, (misnamed) maximum fraction of tracks that can be NaN
             to be accepted
